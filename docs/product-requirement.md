## 1. Product Objectives

Create a website capable of:
- Searching movies by various criteria such as: movie title, actors, directors, or movie content.
- Displaying detailed movie information, including: description, genre, release date, cast, director, poster, trailer, user reviews, ratings from various sources (IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, etc.).
- Automatically collecting (crawling) data from the internet to provide free movie watching links (if available) from public websites that don't require paid subscriptions.

## 2. Key Features

### 2.1 Movie Search

**Functionality:**
Users can enter keywords into the search box, and the system will return a list of matching movies.

**Supported Search Criteria:**
- Movie title (e.g., "Inception")
- Actor name (e.g., "Leonardo DiCaprio")
- Director name (e.g., "Christopher Nolan")
- Content/description (e.g., "dream within a dream")

**Suggested Technology:**
Elasticsearch or an advanced search engine for full-text search capabilities, supporting fuzzy search.

### 2.2 Displaying Detailed Movie Information

**Functionality:**
The movie detail page will display:
- Movie title
- Poster image
- Trailer (YouTube API)
- Brief description
- Genre
- Release date
- Main cast & director
- Aggregate reviews from major sites (IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic)
- User reviews (if available)
- Average rating

**Data Sources:**
- The Movie Database (TMDB) API
- OMDb API
- IMDb (if feasible via API or through crawling)

---

### 2.3 Automatic Search for Free Movie Links

**Functionality:**
- Automatically crawl data from public movie websites (no paid account required), for example: phimmoi, phim14, moviesub, etc.
- Analyze search results from Google, Bing, etc. based on movie titles.
- Return available links to watch movies, possibly with a "consider the safety of the website" warning.

**Suggested Technology:**
- Use Python with Scrapy or Selenium for crawling.
- Apply content filters (regex, AI models) to identify correct movie links.
- Potentially use Google Custom Search API to get search results from the web.

**Legal Considerations:**
Providing free movie links requires careful legal verification. The website should have a clear disclaimer: only displaying public links from third parties, not storing any movie content.

## 4. Non-functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Fast search response under 1 second.
- **Security**: Do not store any movie content to avoid legal risks.
